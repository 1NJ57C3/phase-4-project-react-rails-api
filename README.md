This project is a dungeons and dragons inspired character builder. The app currently is able to auth users and save the character they make to a rails backend using the MVC model. Duelist allows you to create a character with certain attributes, receive randomized starter gear with stats that dynamically update your character attributes and displays a fun sprite image with varying animations.
